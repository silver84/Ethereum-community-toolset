== Attraction, Attention and Affinity analysis of the Ethereum ecosystem

In this analysis I use open source software written in Python [Twecoll] (https://github.com/jdevoo/twecoll/blob/master/README.md) to retrieve data from Twitter and then the open-source software [gephi] for visualizing and analysing large networks graph (https://gephi.org/users/).
