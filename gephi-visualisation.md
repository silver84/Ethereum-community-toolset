# Subcommunities interactions and relationships analysis of the Ethereum ecosystem



The purpose of this analysis is to observe and understand the reciprocal influence of each subcommunity inside the Ethereum ecosystem.


In this analysis I have used a open source command-line tool written in [Python](https://github.com/jdevoo/twecoll/blob/master/README.md) to retrieve data from Twitter and then an open-source [software ](https://gephi.org/users/) for visualizing and analysing large networks graph.

The data collected are public data of the most famous projects twitter account.

I have selected and vested 122 accounts in order to determine their reputation (what is a famous project?) according of standart criteria:

- Does it have a long term historical reputation?
- Does it have a github accounts ?
- Does it have other social media exposure (twitter reddit facebook youtube and so) ?
- How many people are signaling they support this project?
- Is it backed by others official projects or influencer (dev, entrepreneur, analyst) within the ecosystem ?
- What is the probability that it satisfy one of set of needs stated above (usuability, prosperity, value satisfaction)?

You can find the entire list in the [src section](https://github.com/silver84/Ethereum-community-toolset/tree/master/src/raw_dat_and_gml_data).

For some odd reason [Twecoll](https://github.com/jdevoo/twecoll/blob/master/README.md) didn't managed to fletch and process everything (around a dozen of projects).

I appologize in advance if not all famous the project are represented here, I encourage everyone to participate to this collaborative library and add missing data about credible Ethereum project.
